# Js-Project-1
Drawing App
This app is a basic implementation of javascript to form a basic drawing app.
through this app you can make a freehand drawing as well as some limited geometrical shapes as well.
In this app there is a provision of 
* sizing the brush size
* sizing of the eraser.
* check box for the consent to generate the geometrical shapes filled or hollow
* also has the fuctionality of clearing the canvas in one snap and also save the work.

For achieving this we have used the vanilla javaScript and its core concepts.
Following are the concept we used to build this project-
>Document Object Model and Browser Object Model
>different ways of manipulating DOM and BOM
>effect use of the event object to interact with the user.
